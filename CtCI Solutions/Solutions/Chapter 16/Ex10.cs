             * to compute the year with the most number of people alive.
             * You may assume that all people were born between 1900 and 2000 (inclusive).
             * If a person was alive during any portion of that year, they should be included in that year's count.
             * For example, Person (birth = 1908, death = 1909) is included in the counts for both 1908 and 1909.
